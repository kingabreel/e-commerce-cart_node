# E-commerce CLI Cart Service

This is a simple CLI-based e-commerce service to manage users and shopping carts using Node.js.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Node.js installed. To run the CLI:

```bash
node app.js
```
or
```bash
npm start
```

When the application starts, you will see:
```
Choose an action:
(1) Add User
(2) Get User
(3) Add Cart
(4) Get Cart
(5) Get User with Cart
(6) List All Users
(7) Exit
> 
```

## 1. Add a User
Choose option 1 and provide the required details:
```bash
Enter username: johndoe
Enter email: johndoe@example.com
Enter password: mysecurepassword
```
This will create a new user with a unique ID (e.g., 1720199381154).

## 2. Add a Cart
Choose option 3. Youâ€™ll be prompted to paste cart data as JSON. Here's an example you can copy and paste (changing the user id):
```bash

    {
      "id": 101,
      "name": "Wireless Headphones",

    },
    {
